version 1.0.1
- [evolution.cpp] allways stable RLO if q<1.5
- [setup.cpp] converting eccentric anomaly to true anomaly
- [evolution.cpp] post SN coalesce if peri-astron mass transfer

version 1.1.0
- including the carbon core mass (new tables include carbon core mass)

version 1.2.0
- including single star systems (binary fraction in data.in)
- including mergers
- including rotation/synchronisation by tides (tides in data.in, new tables include concentration factor)
- speed output improved
- improve position of interpolated TAMS
- improve accuracy in finding the correct star in the grid
- write track tables in single or debug mode of the system and the components (binary.csv, primary.csv, secondary.csv)
- adopt stellar tables with new criterion for the core mass: m_core=m_tot-M_H/X_H^env, where X_H^env=M_H^env/M^env is the average abundance outside the burning region (where X passes X_thr=0.2*X_s+0.8*X_c), this can better handle convective regions (-> luminosity scaling no longer needed)
- avoid extrapolation beyond stellar age during mass transfer
- bug correction: wrong interpolation ratio in secondarys' lambda
- improve determination of WD mass and keep the core mass info
- implement an alternative angular momentum presciption for the CE
- correting the period distribution by Sana et al. (2012)
- common output format
